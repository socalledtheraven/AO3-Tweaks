# Ao3 Utilities
A chrome extension/firefox addon for a number of little features I want, but can't seem to find easily. Main attractions include:
- mobile support! (haven't tested yet)
  - I read on my phone, so this is a must-have
- modularity!
  - Turn any individual tweak on or off without breaking anything!
- ~~easy configurability!~~
    - Coming soon, with a nice separate page for interface

## Current list of Tweaks:
- Double kudos!
  - Already kudos'd that excellent fic? Now you can automatically leave a comment exclaiming so!
- Latest chapter on updated bookmarks list!
  - Noticed a fave has just updated and want to get right into the new stuff without having to click on the tiny link under the description? Now the main link goes to the final chapter! 
  - This only applies to your bookmarks sorted by update date.
- Mark for Later Button!
  - want the convenience of saving a "To Read" bookmark, but without having to press all those buttons? Fear not! 
  - This will also keep your current bookmark notes, and integrate with the next tweak.
- Bookmark Work details!
  - Ever been looking through your old bookmarks and found one gone without a trace besides when you bookmarked it, and you are left to ponder what had been? I have. 
  - This tweak will save the title, link, author name and summary to your bookmark so you can (hopefully) find an archived copy somehow! 
  - Credit goes to [Tyme LaDow](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/250868-tyme-ladow), who wrote the original version of this under MIT, which I then updated a bit.
- Premade comments!
  - For those times when you have no words, only emotions, the premade comments button gives you a random exuberant comment.
- Comment templates!
  - For those times when you _do_ have words, but are lacking structure or aren't sure how to express them - premade comment starters!
    - both of these comment tweaks are derived from the following sources:

- Comment boxes under each chapter!
  - When you're reading a longfic in full text mode (as one does) and you have many feelings and thoughts but the comment box is all the way at the bottom and you might lose your place or see spoilers and by the time you've finished you forgot what you were going to say... Now there's a comment box under each chapter notes! 
  - Integrates with the above comment tweaks.
