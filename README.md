# Chrome Extension Template!

Welcome to my Chrome extension template for the #templatejam Jam!
With this template, you can easily create a Google Chrome extension in seconds.

# How to use the template
### How to edit the extension
#### Open the "Files" file to edit the extension. Open "Popup.html" to edit the window that opens when you click on the extension. Click on "Manifest.json" to modify file directories, permissions, etc.

### How to download and use your extension
#### Click the 3 dots next to the "Folder" button. Click "Download as Zip". Go to *chrome://extensions* and enable Developer Mode. Unzip the file. Go back to *chrome://extensions* and click "Load Unpacked" and import the "Files" file created when you unzipped the Replit file. Pin the extension from the Chrome window, and you are good to go.

## Enjoy!
